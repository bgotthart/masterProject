	abstract = {We explore a novel ontological approach to user profiling within recommender systems, working on the problem of recommending on-line academic research papers. Our two experimental systems, Quickstep and Foxtrot, create user profiles from unobtrusively monitored behaviour and relevance feedback, representing the profiles in terms of a research paper topic ontology. A novel profile visualization approach is taken to acquire profile feedback. Research papers are classified using ontological classes and collaborative recommendation algorithms used to recommend papers seen by similar people on their current topics of interest. Two small-scale experiments, with 24 subjects over 3 months, and a large-scale experiment, with 260 subjects over an academic year, are conducted to evaluate different aspects of our approach. Ontological inference is shown to improve user profiling, external ontological knowledge used to successfully bootstrap a recommender system and profile visualization employed to improve profiling accuracy. The overall performance of our ontological recommender systems are also presented and favourably compared to other systems in the literature.},

This measure method takes advantage of the Google massive terms and open Google search engine to compute the {NGD} between concepts, and calculates the similarity between web services. Compared with the existing algorithm, we adopt Google terms which present merits of more abundance and updating in a relatively faster speed. This method is simpler and greatly decreases the complexity of calculation because there is no ontology and taxonomy tree, no need to judge the foliatory order, path length, depth and local density. The preliminary results have shown that our algorithm can highly improve the recall and precision of the web service.},

	abstract = {We describe a method of extracting user interests automatically by analyzing entries in users’ blogs 
and present a new style of recommendation based on innovation detection that provides concepts similar 
to those in a user’s profile as well as concepts that are new to the user. We classify user blog entries into 
service domain ontologies and extract interest ontologies that express a user’s interests semantically as 
a hierarchy of classes according to interest weight. We also present Semantic-Driven Collaborative 
Filtering, which is based on similarity measurements between ontologies considering the interest weight 
assigned to each class and instance. We detect innovative blog entries that include concepts that the user 
has not thought about in the past based on an analysis of other user’s ontologies with high similarities to 
that of the user.
By introducing class characteristics about those instances, our technique can offer more accurate 
recommendations than previous collaborative filtering for users with a small number of instances in their 
user profiles. Results obtained with an online experimental service for recommending innovative blog 
entries to users on an actual blog portal confirmed the effectiveness of innovation detection.},

Tagging has emerged as the de-facto standard for the organisation of such resources, providing a versatile and reactive knowledge management mechanism that users find easy to use and understand. It is common nowadays for users to have multiple profiles in various folksonomies, thus distributing their tagging activities. In this paper, we present a method for the automatic consolidation of user profiles across two popular social networking sites, and subsequent semantic modelling of their interests utilising Wikipedia as a multi-domain model. We evaluate how much can be learned from such sites, and in which domains the knowledge acquired is focussed. Results show that far richer interest profiles can be generated for users when multiple tag-clouds are combined.},

The key idea in our approach is to map documents to Wikipedia concepts at different levels of resolution: words, key phrases, sentences, paragraphs, the document summary and the entire document itself. We suggest a method for evaluating profile recall by pooling the relevant results from the different methods and evaluate our results for both precision and recall.

We propose a framework which integrates several critical elements that make up the user context, namely, the user's short-term behavior, semantic knowledge from ontologies that provide explicit representations of the domain of interest, and long-term user profiles revealing interests and trends. Our proposed approach involves implicitly building ontological user profiles by assigning interest scores to existing concepts in a domain ontology. These profiles are, therefore, maintained and updated as annotated instances of a reference domain ontology. We propose a spreading activation algorithm for maintaining the interest scores in the user profile based on the user's ongoing behavior. Our experimental results show that the user context can be effectively utilized for Web search personalization. Specifically, re-ranking the search results based on interest scores derived from the semantic evidence in an ontological user profile provides better search results by proficiently bringing results closer to the top when they are most relevant to the user.},

For computers, the equivalent of "society" is "database," and the equivalent of "use" is "a way to search the database". We present a new theory of similarity between words and phrases based on information distance and Kolmogorov complexity. To fix thoughts, we use the World Wide Web ({WWW)} as the database, and Google as the search engine. The method is also applicable to other search engines and databases. This theory is then applied to construct a method to automatically extract similarity, the Google similarity distance, of words and phrases from the {WWW} using Google page counts. The {WWW} is the largest database on earth, and the context information entered by millions of independent users averages out to provide automatic semantics of useful quality. We give applications in hierarchical clustering, classification, and language translation. We give examples to distinguish between colors and numbers, cluster names of paintings by 17th century Dutch masters and names of books by English novelists, the ability to understand emergencies and primes, and we demonstrate the ability to do a simple automatic English-Spanish translation. Finally, we use the {WordNet} database as an objective baseline against which to judge the performance of our method. We conduct a massive randomized trial in binary classification using support vector machines to learn categories based on our Google distance, resulting in an a mean agreement of 87 percent with the expert crafted {WordNet} categories},

We have improved the existing, Rocchio based algorithm to construct the general profile and user profile for personalization. In our proposed method, we have constructed a Web browser; the information is retrieved through the browser with the aid of category hierarchy. The category hierarchy information will be frequently updated and ranked as per the user's interest during his/her Web search dynamically, the information retrieved is also cached on the client side using semantic cache mechanism which improves the response time.

Users must either browse through a large hierarchy of concepts to find the information for which they are looking or submit a query to a publicly available search engine and wade through hundreds of results, most of them irrelevant. The core of the problem is that whether the user is browsing or searching, whether they are an eighth grade student or a Nobel prize winner, the identical information is selected and it is presented the same way. In this paper, we report on research that adapts information navigation based on a user profile structured as a weighted concept hierarchy. A user may create his or her own concept hierarchy and use them for browsing Web sites. Or, the user profile may be created from a reference ontology by ‘watching over the user’s shoulder’ while they browse. We show that these automatically created profiles reflect the user’s interests quite well and they are able to produce moderate improvements when applied to search results. Current work is investigating the interaction between the user profiles and conceptual search wherein documents are indexed by their concepts in addition to their keywords.},

They get the search query for the user, search for the presence of search words in the web documents, rank them and display the results to the user. The semantics of the user query and also the intention of the user are not considered. Hence to improve searching in the {WWW}, a new personalized search index called User Conceptual Index ({UCI)} has been designed, which provides a conceptual relation between the search keywords and the pages, which matches the user's information need. This paper focuses towards the development of automatically identified user profile called as a personalized ontology and page ontology for the improvement of an existing personalized web search system based on the {UCI.}},

For computers, the equivalent of "society" is "database," and the equivalent of "use" is "a way to search the database". We present a new theory of similarity between words and phrases based on information distance and Kolmogorov complexity. To fix thoughts, we use the World Wide Web ({WWW)} as the database, and Google as the search engine. The method is also applicable to other search engines and databases. This theory is then applied to construct a method to automatically extract similarity, the Google similarity distance, of words and phrases from the {WWW} using Google page counts. The {WWW} is the largest database on earth, and the context information entered by millions of independent users averages out to provide automatic semantics of useful quality. We give applications in hierarchical clustering, classification, and language translation. We give examples to distinguish between colors and numbers, cluster names of paintings by 17th century Dutch masters and names of books by English novelists, the ability to understand emergencies and primes, and we demonstrate the ability to do a simple automatic English-Spanish translation. Finally, we use the {WordNet} database as an objective baseline against which to judge the performance of our method. We conduct a massive randomized trial in binary classification using support vector machines to learn categories based on our Google distance, resulting in an a mean agreement of 87 percent with the expert crafted {WordNet} categories},

The user profile is developed without intervention from the user (but the details of how that is performed is not clear in [13]). While the user is reading a page, Letizia searches, in a breadth-first manner, from that location, pages that could be of interest to the user.

Formal ontologies and taxonomies enrich such hierarchies further with properties and relationships but require manual effort; therefore they are costly to maintain, and often stale. Folksonomies and vocabularies lack rich category structure. Classification and extraction require the coverage of vocabularies and the alterability of folksonomies and can largely benefit from category relationships and other properties. With Doozer, a program for building conceptual models of information domains, we want to bridge the gap between the vocabularies and Folksonomies on the one side and the rich, expert-designed ontologies and taxonomies on the other. Doozer mines Wikipedia to produce tight domain hierarchies, starting with simple domain descriptions. It also adds relevancy scores for use in automated classification of information. The output model is described as a hierarchy of domain terms that can be used immediately for classifiers and {IR} systems or as a basis for manual or semi-automatic creation of formal ontologies.},

	abstract = {As the number of Internet users and accessible Web pages grows; it is becoming increasingly difficult for users to find documents that are relevant to their particular needs. Users must either browse through a large hierarchy of concepts to find the information for which they are looking or submit a query to a publicly available search engine and wade through hundreds of results, most of them irrelevant. The core problem is that whether the user is browsing or searching, whether they are novice web users or experts, the identical information result is retrieved and presented commonly without any difference. The goal of Web search personalization is to tailor search results to a particular user based on that user's interests and preferences, thus allowing for more efficient and relevant information access. Personalization of information retrieval involves two major challenges: identifying the user context and organizing them in such a way that improves the search precision. This leads to the development of user profiles in a hierarchical structure namely ontology for user profiles. The main goal of this paper is to propose a technique that implicitly builds ontology-based user profiles. We build and update profiles dynamically by monitoring and storing the user's browsing habits.},

We propose a framework which integrates several critical elements that make up the user context, namely, the user's short-term behavior, semantic knowledge from ontologies that provide explicit representations of the domain of interest, and long-term user profiles revealing interests and trends. Our proposed approach involves implicitly building ontological user profiles by assigning interest scores to existing concepts in a domain ontology. These profiles are, therefore, maintained and updated as annotated instances of a reference domain ontology. We propose a spreading activation algorithm for maintaining the interest scores in the user profile based on the user's ongoing behavior. Our experimental results show that the user context can be effectively utilized for Web search personalization. Specifically, re-ranking the search results based on interest scores derived from the semantic evidence in an ontological user profile provides better search results by proficiently bringing results closer to the top when they are most relevant to the user.},

Compared with the existing algorithm, we adopt Google terms which present merits of more abundance and updating in a relatively faster speed.

Each web page can then be assigned to nodes in the hierarchy for further processing in learning and predicting interests. This approach is analogous to building a subject taxonomy for a library catalog system and assigning books to the taxonomy. Our approach does not need user involvement and learns the {UIH} "implicitly." Furthermore, it allows the original objects, web pages, to be assigned to multiple topics (nodes in the hierarchy). In this paper, we focus on learning the {UIH} from a set of visited pages. We propose a few similarity functions and dynamic threshold-finding methods, and evaluate the resulting hierarchies according to their meaningfulness and shape},

	abstract = {The most popular way for finding information on the Web is go to a search engine, submit a query that describes an information need and receive a list of results that relate to the information sought. As more and more topics are being discussed over the Web and our vocabulary remains relatively stable, it is increasingly difficult for Web users to select queries that express their varying information needs in a distinguishable by the engine manner. Query refinement is the process of providing information seekers with alternative wordings for expressing their search intentions. Although refined queries may contribute to the improvement of retrieval results, nevertheless their realization is intrinsically limited in that they consider nothing about the preferences of the user issuing that query. One way to go about selecting suitable query alternatives is to account for the user interests in the query refinement process. This task involves two great challenges. First we need to be able to effectively identify the user preferences and build a profile for every user. Second, once such a profile is available, we need to identify among a set of candidate query alternatives those that match the user interests. In this article, we present our work towards a personalized query refinement technique and we discuss how we address both of these challenges. Since Web users are reluctant to provide explicit information on their personal preferences, for the first challenge we attempt to determine them based on the analysis of the users' click history. In particular, we leverage a topical ontology for estimating the user's topic preferences based on her past searches. For the second challenge, we have developed a query refinement mechanism that uses the learnt user preferences in order to disambiguate the user's current query and thereafter identify alternative query wordings that match both the initial query semantics and the user preferences. Our experiments show that user preferences can be learnt accurately through the use of the topical ontology and refined queries based on the user preferences yield significant improvements in the search quality over existing query improvement techniques.},

Our two experimental systems, Quickstep and Foxtrot, create user profiles from unobtrusively monitored behaviour and relevance feedback, representing the profiles in terms of a research paper topic ontology. A novel profile visualization approach is taken to acquire profile feedback. Research papers are classified using ontological classes and collaborative recommendation algorithms used to recommend papers seen by similar people on their current topics of interest. Two small-scale experiments, with 24 subjects over 3 months, and a large-scale experiment, with 260 subjects over an academic year, are conducted to evaluate different aspects of our approach. Ontological inference is shown to improve user profiling, external ontological knowledge used to successfully bootstrap a recommender system and profile visualization employed to improve profiling accuracy. The overall performance of our ontological recommender systems are also presented and favourably compared to other systems in the literature.},

	abstract = {The Open Directory Project is clearly one of the largest collaborative efforts to manually annotate web pages. This effort involves over 65,000 editors and resulted in metadata specifying topic and importance for more than 4 million web pages. Still, given that this number is just about 0.05 percent of the Web pages indexed by Google, is this effort enough to make a difference? In this paper we discuss how these metadata can be exploited to achieve high quality personalized web search. First, we address this by introducing an additional criterion for web page ranking, namely the distance between a user profile defined using {ODP} topics and the sets of {ODP} topics covered by each {URL} returned in regular web search. We empirically show that this enhancement yields better results than current web search using Google. Then, in the second part of the paper, we investigate the boundaries of biasing {PageRank} on subtopics of the {ODP} in order to automatically extend these metadata to the whole web.},

	abstract = {With the exponentially growing amount of information available on the Internet, the task of retrieving documents of interest has become increasingly difficult. Search engines usually return more than 1,500 results per query, yet out of the top twenty results, only one half turn out to be relevant to the user. One reason for this is that Web queries are in general very short and give an incomplete specification of individual users' information needs. This paper explores ways of incorporating users' interests into the search process to improve the results. The user profiles are structured as a concept hierarchy of 4,400 nodes. These are populated by `watching over a user's shoulder' while he is surfing. No explicit feedback is necessary. The profiles are shown to converge and to reflect the actual interests quite well. One possible deployment of the profiles is investigated: re-ranking and filtering search results. Increases in performance are moderate but noticeable and show that fully ...},

	abstract = {Personalized web search is a promising way to improve search quality by customizing search results for people with individual information goals. However, users are uncomfortable with exposing private preference information to search engines. On the other hand, privacy is not absolute, and often can be compromised if there is a gain in service or profitability to the user. Thus, a balance must be struck between search quality and privacy protection. This paper presents a scalable way for users to automatically build rich user profiles. These profiles summarize a user.s interests into a hierarchical organization according to specific interests. Two parameters for specifying privacy requirements are proposed to help the user to choose the content and degree of detail of the profile information that is exposed to the search engine. Experiments showed that the user profile improved search quality when compared to standard {MSN} rankings. More importantly, results verified our hypothesis that a significant improvement on search quality can be achieved by only sharing some higher-level user profile information, which is potentially less sensitive than detailed personal information.},
